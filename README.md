Programming journal for 2026. Weekly entries &amp; code.

# About Me
My name is Josh Andazola. In 2023 I graduated with degrees in Accounting and Information Systems from New Mexico State University and am now working as a technology consultant implementing EPM (Enterprise Performance Management) software. With deep interests in the intersection of accounting and technology, I set a goal for myself this year to strengthen my niche by aherring to a daily commitment of programming in any capacity (particularly using Python), as well as a weekly commitment of completing and publishing in this repo one small "thing" (i.e., small automation script/function, analysis of a dataset, explanation of some solved problem) and blog post per week. The thought process behind this goal is "Quality is a lagging indicator. Consistency is the leading indicator." If I can create a consistent habit of programming, my hope is that I can not just be a better python programmer, but cultivate a mindset of how to solve problems computationally.
